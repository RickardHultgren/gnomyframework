\section{In Short: The Gnomy Framework}
The Gnomy Framework is a compass for emotional and strategic clarity. It helps people slow down, reflect deeply, and move forward wisely. It belongs in the toolkit of coaches, creators, leaders, therapists, facilitators, and reflective individuals seeking to bridge emotion and action with intelligence and care.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{GNOMY.png}
\end{center}
Imagine this: A Gnomish Journey of Pond-Bound Reflection. A small gnome stands on a delicate, hybrid plant – perhaps a blend of strawberry and water lily – nestled within a tranquil pond. This pond embodies a specific context, while the individual plant represents a distinct situation. Plants in this pond are interconnected by slender tendrils.

In their left hand, the gnome holds a lantern of current feeling. From bottles in their belt, filled with luminescent powder of different colours, the gnome pours some powder into the lantern, and it begins to glow. This represents the \textbf{FLAME} of their inner narrative.

On the right shoulder, a black crow perches confidently, ready to fly to other gnomes with messages. This embodies \textbf{CROWS}, understanding how others shape their story.

In their left hand, the gnome juggles a glowing spark, catching it with practiced joy. This spark floats in the air, manipulated by the gnome's twisting hand, creating a gentle wind that gathers dried leaves from the gnome's leaf-heap. This symbolizes \textbf{SPARK}, uncovering resources and possibilities.

In their right hand, the gnome holds a single sage leaf, dry and bitter on the tongue. It's a reminder: wisdom isn't always sweet. It comes with limits, trade-offs, and hard-earned truths. This represents \textbf{SAGE}, facing risks and choosing wisely.

And so, this gnome walks -- leaving footprints shaped by emotion, relationship, strength, and restraint. Every step is a journey through GNOMY: Grounding, Narrative, Others, More, and Yikes! (Reflection, Story, Others, Courage, and Change).

\section{The Gnomy Framework: Your Step-By-Step Guide}

\subsection{Step 0: Grounding (FIND) — Find Your Inner Position}
Before diving into analysis or action, ground yourself in the present moment to regain perspective. Grounding prepares your mind and body for reflective, intentional thinking. Use the \textbf{FIND} sequence to anchor yourself:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Feel your breath}: Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4. This regulates your nervous system and slows racing thoughts.
    \item \textbf{Introduce pause}: Silently say, ``It's just in my mind.'' This gentle mantra reminds you that thoughts and feelings aren't permanent truths—they're experiences to notice and explore.
    \item \textbf{Notice curiosity}: Ask yourself, ``What else can I find?'' This cultivates an open, inquisitive mindset instead of spiraling into judgment or avoidance.
    \item \textbf{Define your main character}: Whose perspective should you proceed from? Your own, or someone else's? Shifting perspectives helps illuminate new choices and motivations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 1: Narrative of Emotion and Meaning}

\subsubsection{1.1 Narrative (FLAME) – Explore Your Emotions and Their Roots}
Emotions are signals, not noise. They reflect unmet needs, broken expectations, or meaningful desires. Like a flame in a storm-lantern, your emotions illuminate your inner landscape. Use \textbf{FLAME} to dive into your emotional narrative:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{F – Feelings}: What specific emotions are present right now (e.g., frustration, anxiety, hope, joy)? What's their intensity?
    \item \textbf{L – Languish}: In what ways are you feeling emotionally drained or stuck? Where do these feelings show up in your body, and what situations or thoughts trigger them?
    \item \textbf{A – Attitude}: What's your current Attitude or stance towards this challenge or situation? Is it one of resistance, curiosity, overwhelm, or acceptance?
    \item \textbf{M – Meaning}: What Meaning do you make of these feelings? What needs are unmet, what expectations were broken, or what desires are they pointing to?
    \item \textbf{E – Essence}: What's the core Essence of the pain point or challenge? What hurts or feels threatened? What's been violated or lost? In personal narratives, this maps to internal ``subgroups'' like competing goals or unresolved identities. A neglected ``part'' of yourself might sabotage progress or provoke disproportionate emotion due to misalignment or burnout.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1.2 Others (CROWS) – Who Else Is Part of This Emotional Story?}
We are shaped by relationships—past, present, and imagined. A crow will fly to other gnomes, inviting them to transfer their insights to your understanding. Ask \textbf{CROWS} to place your experience in a broader social context:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Current others}: Who else is involved now? How do their perspectives or emotions interact with yours?
    \item \textbf{Retrospective self}: How would your past self interpret or feel about this?
    \item \textbf{Optional future self}: What emotional legacy are you creating? What might your future self think or feel?
    \item \textbf{Wished-for others}: Are there people you hope to connect with or impress? Fantasies, role models, or longings?
    \item \textbf{Shared past}: What shared experiences or histories are influencing this moment?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 2: Reframe Through Shared Competence and Action}

\subsubsection{2.1 More (SPARK) – Uncover Resources, Strengths, and Options}
A situation is represented by the plant in the pond that the gnome is standing on. In order to move to another plant, the gnome needs to use the spark. The gnome moves the floating spark by twisting the left hand. The spark manipulates the wind around it, allowing the gnome to move the spark towards a leaf heap that the gnome owns. With the spark, the gnome makes a leaf blow towards the plant that the gnome is standing on. The gnome then uses the leaf as a cable ferry by standing on the leaf and pulling the tendril that is between the plants.

Move from awareness to possibility. Expand your narrative understanding through the wisdom of other gnomes or your own inner resources. Use SPARK to inventory the personal and interpersonal resources available to you:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Strengths}: What abilities, traits, or skills do you bring to this moment?
    \item \textbf{Possibilities}: What courses of action exist? Be creative—don't filter options yet.
    \item \textbf{Assets}: What tangible and intangible resources (e.g., tools, time, information, shared community resources) can you rely on?
    \item \textbf{Resourced Relationships}: Who can walk with you in this? Who offers strength, support, challenge, or insight?
    \item \textbf{Knowledge \& Experience}: What lessons have you already learned? What frameworks or facts do you already hold?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2.2 Yikes! (SAGE) – Face Risks, Limits, and Priorities}
On the tendril there are sage leaves growing, symbolizing the wisdom and often bitter truths involved in facing risks. Before committing to action, reflect on risk, responsibility, and refinement. Use \textbf{SAGE} to evaluate outcomes and adapt.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Spectrum}: Define three kinds of outcomes:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
        \item \textbf{Scary}: What's the worst-case scenario? What would feel like a failure?
        \item \textbf{Sufficient}: What's ``good enough'' to move forward?
        \item \textbf{Successful}: What would a meaningful win look like?
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Actions}: For each outcome, what are possible reactions or strategies?
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
        \textbf{Avoidance}: What might I try to escape or delay?
        \textbf{Anchoring}: What stable actions keep me grounded under stress?
        \textbf{Aspiration}: What bold or creative steps move me toward success?
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gauge}: Assess urgency and importance.
    \item \textbf{Evolution}: The world changes—and so do you.
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
        \item \textbf{Examine}: What feedback are you receiving?
        \item \textbf{Evaluate}: What's working, what's not?
        \item \textbf{Edit}: What needs adjusting or dropping?
        \item \textbf{Expand}: Connect to the pain-points. Reflect on what changed through your Gnomy process. What pain points were resolved? What challenges remain or new tensions arose? Who benefited, who was affected, and what became clearer? Share this with those impacted by the results. This step isn't just closure—it's a bridge to the next cycle, grounding future action in real insight and shared learning.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feedback Loop}
If your plan feels shaky, your emotions shift, or new obstacles appear, return to Step 0 (\textbf{Grounding}) or Step 1 (\textbf{Narrative}). The Gnomy Framework is cyclical and flexible—designed for ongoing clarity, growth, and recalibration.

\section{Why the Gnomy Framework Should Work}

\subsection{Mindfulness \& Grounding (FIND)}
DBT Mindfulness \& MBSR provide strong evidence that grounding techniques like breathing and pausing improve emotional regulation, reduce anxiety, and enhance cognitive clarity \cite{linehan1993cognitive, kabat1990full}. Gnomy's FIND sequence—``Feel breath, Introduce pause, Notice curiosity, Define perspective''—mirrors widely used and validated techniques such as STOP and body scans in DBT.

\subsection{Narrative \& Externalization (FLAME + CROWS)}
Psychological research and therapeutic models such as Narrative Therapy \cite{white1990narrative}, Internal Family Systems (IFS) \cite{schwartz1995internal}, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) \cite{beck1979cognitive} support the idea that naming emotions and constructing coherent narratives helps reduce distress and increase meaning. The FLAME step aligns with these methods by encouraging emotional labeling, meaning-making, and introspective clarity. The CROWS stage brings in elements of mentalization \cite{fonagy2002affect}, perspective-taking, and attachment theory \cite{bowlby1969attachment}—all essential for emotional intelligence and relationship repair. Reflecting on the role of others (real, imagined, past, future) creates space for compassion, re-interpretation, and systemic insight.

\subsection{Resource-Oriented Thinking (SPARK)}
SPARK mirrors concepts from solution-focused brief therapy \cite{de1997building}, positive psychology \cite{seligman2011flourish}, and resilience theory. Shifting attention toward resources, relationships, and internal strengths has been shown to increase optimism, motivation, and problem-solving capacity. It also encourages autonomy and competence—two key components of self-determination theory \cite{ryan2000self}.

\subsection{Risk Mapping \& Action Planning (SAGE)}
The SAGE component integrates strategic foresight/scenario planning \cite{schoemaker1995scenario}, stress inoculation training \cite{meichenbaum1985stress}, and values-based decision-making. By identifying outcome spectrums (Scary–Sufficient–Successful) and categorizing strategies (Avoid–Anchor–Aspire), users are better equipped to evaluate trade-offs, mitigate anxiety, and act intentionally. It also reflects ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) principles by balancing risk acceptance with committed action \cite{hayes1999acceptance}, and the OODA loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act) from military
