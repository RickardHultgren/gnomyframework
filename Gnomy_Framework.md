# The Gnomish Journey: A Metaphorical Compass

![image](GNOMY.png){width="\\linewidth"}

Imagine this: A Gnomish Journey of Pond-Bound Reflection. A small gnome
stands on a delicate, hybrid plant --- perhaps a blend of strawberry and
water lily --- nestled within a tranquil pond. This pond embodies a
specific context, while the individual plant represents a distinct
situation. Plants in this pond are interconnected by slender tendrils.
The leaves and the tendrils of the platns havew sharp thorns (pain
points of the situation). This metaphor serves as a cognitive anchor,
associating specific actions or mental states with distinct metaphorical
elements, thereby becoming a quick mental shortcut for recalling and
applying the framework's principles, especially during moments of stress
or complexity.

## Understanding the Symbol System {#understanding-the-symbol-system .unnumbered}

The visual metaphor of the Gnomy Framework operates through an
integrated system of symbols, where each element carries a specific
meaning and interacts dynamically with the others:

-   **The Plant (Situation):** Each plant represents a distinct
    situation. *Tendrils* stretch between plants, symbolizing the
    actions or transitions required to move from one situation to
    another. *Thorns* mark points of friction, frustration, or
    pain---places where the gnome's competence or autonomy feels
    blocked. As the gnome develops workarounds through emotional
    adaptation or cognitive reappraisal, new, lighter tendrils grow
    around or over the thorns, illustrating growth and learning. Some
    tendrils connect to other plants, while others loop back to
    different parts of the same plant, representing reflection or
    internal problem-solving. Occasionally, a tendril remains loose
    until the gnome throws it outward, seeking something for it to
    attach to. Certain gnomes are naturally resistant or immune to
    specific thorns.

-   **The Lantern Glow (Emotion):** The lantern's light changes in color
    and radius depending on the gnome's emotional tone and clarity. When
    the light is dim or narrow, the gnome perceives only nearby thorns
    and becomes entangled---representing emotional tunnel vision. When
    the light broadens or becomes more colorful, the gnome perceives
    more tendrils, symbolizing emotional understanding and access to
    alternative perspectives. The glow also reveals previously hidden
    tendrils.

-   **The Crows (Relatedness):** Crows carry messages written in glowing
    powder, facilitating emotional and social exchange between gnomes.
    When a crow delivers this powder to another gnome's lantern, it
    illuminates specific parts of the plant---showing how relationships
    influence attention, meaning, and emotional tone. The powder
    shimmers like pollen dust, revealing hidden tendrils or even
    transforming thorns into buds when empathy or understanding is
    reached.

-   **The Tendrils (Perceived Possibilities):** Tendrils may be latent
    (already present but unseen) or projected (actively lassoed outward
    by the gnome). When the gnome's lantern brightens or receives a
    crow's message, hidden tendrils become visible---representing
    insight or new connections. When the gnome throws a tendril outward,
    it signifies creative problem-solving or hope---the act of imagining
    a possible bridge before it becomes real. Successfully attached
    tendrils pulse and thicken like living cables.

-   **The Fallen Leaves (Action Pathways):** Each gnome maintains a heap
    of fallen leaves, representing collected skills or competences.
    These leaves can serve as small ferries across the pond water, with
    tendrils acting as their guiding cables---allowing the gnome to move
    toward another, or sometimes the same, plant. The leaf pathways
    embody the gnome's practical ability to act upon insight.

-   **The Spark (Agency):** The spark represents the act of doing---the
    moment of agency and initiative. Hovering above the gnome's left
    hand, the glowing spark stirs a gentle wind that gathers dried
    leaves from the leaf heap. This symbolizes the uncovering of inner
    resources and the use of learned competences to navigate the garden.
    The gathered leaves become vessels for movement: some leading
    outward to new plants (external change), others curling inward
    (internal reflection).

**Dynamic Interactions:** The messages carried by crows change both the
plant and lantern glow, as well as how clearly the gnome sees the
tendrils to other plants. When a crow arrives with glowing powder, the
lantern changes hue; this glow spreads along tendrils, softening some
thorns and revealing new tendrils. The gnome then notices that some
leaves (decisions) can now connect to other plants---paths that were
invisible before.

**Frustration and Growth:** The framework visualizes learning as a
transformation process: thorns represent blocked needs, covering thorns
with new tendrils shows coping or adaptation, and thorns transforming
into buds represents genuine emotional growth. When multiple gnomes
exchange messages, their collective pattern can reshape the plant:
tangled roots straighten, or new shared branches grow---showing social
resonance and narrative alignment.

## Key Metaphorical Elements: {#key-metaphorical-elements .unnumbered}

-   **FIND the LENS:** The Gnome wears glasses. The right lens helps see
    the *antagonist* in the situation (who this is about), while the
    left lens helps see the *causing force* (deuteragonist or
    antagonist). These glasses represent gaining perspective and
    discerning different appraisals. As the gnome adjusts their glasses,
    the lantern's glow shifts, revealing previously hidden tendrils or
    softening visible thorns.

-   **LUX Lantern model:** In their left hand, the gnome holds a lantern
    of current feeling. From bottles in their belt, filled with
    luminescent powder of different colours, the gnome pours some powder
    into the lantern, and it begins to glow. This symbolizes
    illuminating your inner narrative and emotional landscape. The
    lantern's light changes color and radius---when dim or narrow, only
    nearby thorns are visible; when broad and colorful, multiple
    tendrils become apparent, expanding perceived possibilities.

-   **CROWS:** On the right shoulder, a black crow perches confidently,
    ready to fly to other gnomes with messages. This embodies
    understanding how others shape your story and considering external
    perspectives. When a crow delivers a message carrying glowing
    powder, it temporarily alters the receiver's lantern color,
    revealing new aspects of their plant and making hidden tendrils
    visible---showing how relationships transform perception and
    emotional awareness.

-   **SPARK:** Above the left hand, the glowing spark is floating in the
    air, manipulated by the gnome's twisting hand, creating a gentle
    wind that gathers dried leaves from the gnome's leaf-heap. This
    symbolizes uncovering resources and possibilities, using them to
    navigate. These leaves become the vessels for movement---some
    leading outward to new plants (external change), others curling
    inward (internal reflection).

-   **SAGE:** In their right hand, the gnome holds a single sage leaf,
    dry and bitter on the tongue. It's a reminder: wisdom isn't always
    sweet. It comes with limits, trade-offs, and hard-earned truths.
    This represents facing risks and choosing wisely. The sage grows
    along the tendrils between plants, marking the path of growth and
    the places where thorns have been transformed into learning.

And so, this gnome walks---leaving footprints shaped by emotion,
relationship, strength, and restraint. Every step is a journey through
GNOMY: Grounding, Narrative, Others, More, and Yikes! As the gnome
moves, thorns may soften or transform into buds through emotional
growth, new tendrils may sprout from collective exchanges, and the
ever-shifting lantern glow reveals pathways that were always there,
waiting to be seen.

# The Gnomy Framework: Your Step-By-Step Guide

The Gnomy Framework is designed to be a practical tool. This section
provides detailed, actionable prompts for each step, transforming
theoretical concepts into tangible user experiences.

## Step 0: Grounding (FIND the LENS) --- Find Your Inner Position

**FIND the LENS** helps you regain perspective by pausing to explore
goals, emotions, and responsibility with intention. Before diving into
analysis or action, ground yourself in the present moment to regain
perspective. Grounding prepares your mind and body for reflective,
intentional thinking. Use the **FIND** sequence to anchor yourself and
then apply the **LENS** to discern different appraisals.

::: center
:::

-   **F --- Feel your breath/urge**: Embodied grounding. Helps interrupt
    reactivity and build emotional awareness before analysis.

    -   *Now feel your urge---and others' urges.*

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Appraisal dimension: Goal Relevance**

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:**

        -   \"What urge is arising in me right now? What is the physical
            sensation associated with it?\"

        -   \"What is the emotional signal behind it? (e.g., anger,
            fear, sadness, excitement)\"

        -   \"What urge might be arising in the other people involved?
            How might their physical or emotional state be similar or
            different from mine?\"

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Insight:** Emotions signal that a **goal
        or value is at stake**---yours or someone else's. Tune into that
        signal. This aligns with DBT's emphasis on emotional awareness
        [@linehan1993cognitive].

-   **I --- Introduce pause**: Goal-mapping and perspective expansion.
    Surfaces implicit motivations and helps distinguish between
    short-term urges and deeper goals.

    -   *Silently say: \"It's just in my mind.\" This reminds you that
        goals live inside individual minds.*

    -   *Now ask: \"What else can I find?\"*

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Appraisal dimensions: Goal Congruence &
        Hidden Goals**

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:**

        -   \"What other goals (both explicit and implicit) are
            connected to the topic for me?\"

        -   \"What are the loudest or most obvious goals right now, and
            what are the quieter, underlying ones?\"

        -   \"What goals am I affected by---but might not be fully aware
            of---from others involved or from the broader context?\"

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Insight:** We often focus on the loudest
        or most conscious goals, but **conflicting or background goals
        may be shaping your reactions**---and others'. This step expands
        on Lazarus's primary appraisal of goal congruence
        [@lazarus1984stress].

-   **N --- Notice urgency**: Action-orientation + systems thinking.
    Asks what can be done constructively, not just what is felt.
    Encourages agency over rumination.

    -   *Ask yourself: What can I do about the expressed and
        non-received goals?*

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Appraisal dimension: Coping Potential**

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:**

        -   \"Which goals feel most urgent or pressing for me and for
            others?\"

        -   \"What specific actions are possible right now to address
            these urgent goals, even small ones?\"

        -   \"What's outside of my immediate control or influence in
            this situation? How can I accept that?\"

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Insight:** Urgency often comes from
        feeling like we can't act on a critical goal. **Noticing what's
        doable helps restore emotional agency.** This reflects Lazarus's
        secondary appraisal of coping potential [@lazarus1984stress].

-   **D --- Discern Stakes (and Divine Compassion)**: Narrative
    humility, shared responsibility. Avoids blame, embraces complexity,
    promotes collective insight and equity thinking. Instead of
    assigning responsibility, **Discern Stakes** invites a humble
    inquiry into who is experiencing the highest emotional or physical
    vulnerability in this situation. From a spiritual appraisal
    perspective, this isn't about blame, but recognizing the deepest
    \"sacred concerns\" or \"spiritual goals\" at risk.

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Appraisal dimensions: Goal Significance
        & Existential Threat.**

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:**

        -   \"For whom are the **emotional stakes highest** right now?
            (e.g., fear of loss, profound grief, intense anxiety). What
            specific emotions indicate these high stakes?\"

        -   \"Who faces the **greatest physical vulnerability** or
            potential harm in this situation?\"

        -   \"What **core values or sense of purpose** feel most
            threatened for different individuals involved? (This links
            emotions to our relationship with the sacred or ultimate
            concerns, extending traditional appraisal theory).\"

        -   \"How can I approach this discernment with **deep compassion
            and humility** for all experiencing high stakes, even those
            whose actions I might disagree with?\"

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Insight:** Emotions are signals that
        something deeply valuable, perhaps even sacred, is at stake. By
        humbly discerning these vulnerabilities across all involved, we
        cultivate empathy and open a path towards responses rooted in
        compassion rather than judgment, aligning with a spiritual
        understanding of interconnected suffering and well-being.

### **Applying the LENS: Layered Emotive Narratives of Stakes** {#applying-the-lens-layered-emotive-narratives-of-stakes .unnumbered}

**LENS** This framework emphasizes understanding a situation by viewing
it through different \"lenses.\" This component represents a unique
extension of Lazarus's appraisal theory, introducing relational and
temporal dimensions to emotional appraisal.

First, establish the timeframe of the situation: past, current, or
future.

Next, identify the protagonist as the individual or group with the most
to gain or save in the narrative. The deuteragonist or antagonist
(depending on whether they intend to help or harm the protagonist's
cause) is then identified as the party working towards or against the
protagonist's goal.

Each letter in this framework represents a pair of contrasting
appraisals---one from the protagonist's perspective and the other from
the antagonist's---at different points in time. These appraisals draw
upon Lazarus's concepts of primary and secondary appraisals, but are
uniquely framed within Gnomy's relational context.

-   **L - Loss (Past) vs. Legitimacy (Past)**

    -   **Protagonist (Your View):** Focus on the **Loss** (Harm/Loss)
        endured in the past. *Prompt: \"What specific harm or loss have
        I experienced or perceived in the past related to this
        situation?\"*

    -   **Antagonist (Their View):** Focus on the **Legitimacy** of
        their past actions or the perceived \"credit\" they deserve for
        outcomes you see as harmful. *Prompt: \"From their perspective,
        what past actions do they believe were justified or what credit
        do they feel they deserve for past outcomes, even if I see them
        as harmful?\"*

    -   *Paired Appraisals:* Harm/Loss (Primary) vs. Blame/Credit
        (Secondary, from their view).

-   **E - Effort (Present) vs. Entitlement (Present)**

    -   **Protagonist (Your View):** Focus on the **Effort** (Challenge)
        being exerted in the present to overcome difficulties. *Prompt:
        \"What challenges am I currently facing, and what effort am I
        putting in to overcome them?\"*

    -   **Antagonist (Their View):** Focus on their **Entitlement** or
        belief in their *current* rightness, or the perception that your
        challenge is due to their justified actions. *Prompt: \"From
        their perspective, what are they doing now that they believe is
        justified, and why might they feel entitled to their current
        position or actions?\"*

    -   *Paired Appraisals:* Challenge (Primary) vs. Coping Potential
        (Secondary, their perceived control/justification).

-   **N - Nuisance (Future) vs. Necessity (Future)**

    -   **Protagonist (Your View):** Views their actions/existence as a
        **Nuisance** (Threat) for the future. *Prompt: \"How do I
        perceive their potential future actions or presence as a threat
        or nuisance to my goals or well-being?\"*

    -   **Antagonist (Their View):** Views their future actions as a
        **Necessity** for their goals, even if it threatens yours.
        *Prompt: \"From their perspective, what future actions do they
        see as absolutely necessary for their own goals, even if it
        impacts me negatively?\"*

    -   *Paired Appraisals:* Threat (Primary) vs. Future Expectations
        (Secondary, their predicted justified outcomes).

-   **S - Safety (Your Goal) vs. Supremacy (Their Goal)**

    -   **Protagonist (Your View):** Primarily seeking **Safety** and
        well-being. *Prompt: \"What is my ultimate goal in this
        situation --- what does safety or well-being look like for
        me?\"*

    -   **Antagonist (Their View):** Primarily seeking **Supremacy** or
        dominance in the situation. *Prompt: \"What does their ultimate
        goal appear to be --- is it about control, winning, or asserting
        dominance?\"*

    -   *General Goal Contrast: This is more of an overarching
        contextual goal than a specific appraisal, but it helps frame
        the differing drivers.*

## Step 1: Narrative of Emotion and Meaning

### 1.1 Narrative (LUX) --- Exploring Emotions and Their Roots

Emotions are signals, not noise. They reveal unmet needs, broken
expectations, and meaningful desires. The **LUX Lantern Model** supports
the exploration of emotional narratives by illuminating one's inner
landscape along three key axes. This model uniquely integrates
neurochemical correlates with the Kano Model's feature categories to
help interpret emotional responses.

Emotions arise both from one's own situation and from the narratives
shared by others. When another gnome sends a message, it is written with
*glowing powder*---emotional content that enters your lantern and
influences how you perceive your surroundings. If you extend a *tendril*
toward another gnome's plant, you can travel along that tendril, drawing
closer, allowing your lantern to partially illuminate the situation that
the other gnome is experiencing.

::: center
:::

-   **L --- Longing (Dopamine $\times$ Kano's Attractive Features)**
    This axis represents desire, hope, and intrinsic motivation. What do
    you long for in this situation? What possibilities pull you forward
    or spark joy? *Proposed link:* Dopamine is associated with
    reward-seeking and motivation, aligning with Kano's "Attractive
    Features"---aspects that create delight when present but are not
    expected.

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:** "What do I genuinely appreciate
        in this situation?"

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:** "What do I hope or wish for from
        this situation?"

-   **U --- Usefulness (Serotonin $\times$ Kano's Performance
    Features)** This axis concerns reliability, control, and competence.
    How does this situation affect your sense of self-worth, stability,
    or capability? What feels steady and supportive? *Proposed link:*
    Serotonin is linked to well-being, stability, and
    confidence---qualities that parallel Kano's "Performance Features,"
    which generate satisfaction when functioning properly.

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:** "Which 'performance
        features'---the expected functions of this situation---are
        working or not working, and how does that affect me?"

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:** "In what ways do I manage these
        challenges? (Which tendrils help me avoid being hurt by the
        thorns?)"

-   **X --- X-Friction (Noradrenaline $\times$ Kano's Must-Be/Reverse
    Features)** This axis addresses stress, threat, and unmet basic
    needs. What obstacles, irritations, or pressures are you facing?
    What feels essential---something whose absence causes strong
    distress? *Proposed link:* Noradrenaline is associated with
    vigilance and stress response, corresponding to Kano's "Must-Be" or
    "Reverse Features," which, when absent, produce dissatisfaction or
    alarm.

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:** "What specific threats,
        irritations, or pressures am I experiencing right now?"

    -   **$\blacktriangleright$ Ask:** "What challenges do I want to
        overcome? (Which thorns on the current plant am I confronting?)"

### 1.2 Others (CROWS) --- Who Else Is Part of This Emotional Story?

We are shaped by relationships---past, present, and imagined. A crow
will fly to other gnomes, inviting them to transfer their insights to
your understanding. Ask **CROWS** to place your experience in a broader
social context, fostering mentalization and perspective-taking.

Crows know from what situation/position they fly. They try to find a
similar lantern light on the same plant. Each message a crow carries
contains glowing powder that temporarily changes the receiver's lantern
color, revealing or highlighting certain parts of their plant---showing
how relationships direct attention and emotional tone. When the powder
shimmers across the plant surface, it can make specific leaves and
tendrils visible, or even transform thorns into buds when empathy is
reached, demonstrating the transformative power of relational
understanding.

-   **C --- Current others**: Who else is involved now? How do their
    perspectives or emotions interact with yours? *Prompt: \"Who are the
    key people currently involved in this situation? What might they be
    thinking, feeling, or needing right now? How might their messages
    (metaphorically carried by crows) change the color of my lantern and
    reveal new aspects of this plant?\"*

-   **R --- Retrospective self**: How would your past self interpret or
    feel about this? What lessons from past experiences are relevant
    now? *Prompt: \"If my past self (e.g., 5 years ago, or during a
    similar challenge) looked at this situation, what would they think
    or feel? What lessons did I learn then that apply now? What 'glow
    powder' from past experiences can illuminate current hidden
    tendrils?\"*

-   **O --- Optional future self**: What emotional legacy are you
    creating? What might your future self think or feel? *Prompt:
    \"Imagine your future self, perhaps a year from now, looking back at
    this moment. What emotional legacy do you want to have created? What
    advice would your wise future self give you? Which thorns might they
    see as transformed into buds?\"*

-   **W --- Wished-for others**: Are there people you hope to connect
    with or impress? Fantasies, role models, or longings? *Prompt: \"Are
    there people (real or imagined, like role models or mentors) whose
    opinions or approval I value in this context? What kind of
    connection or impact do I wish to have with them? What new tendrils
    might their perspective reveal?\"*

-   **S --- Shared past**: What shared experiences or histories are
    influencing this moment? *Prompt: \"What shared experiences,
    histories, or agreements (or disagreements) are influencing this
    moment for all involved? How does our collective history shape
    current dynamics and emotions? When multiple gnomes exchange
    messages, how might their collective pattern reshape the
    plant---straightening tangled roots or growing new shared
    branches?\"*

## Step 2: Reframe Through Shared Competence and Action

### 2.1 More (SPARK) --- Uncover Resources, Strengths, and Options

Imagine the gnome's current situation as a plant in a pond. To move to
another \"situation\" (represented by a different plant), the gnome
needs a leaf boat---an old, dried leaf from their personal leaf heap.
The gnome steers a floating spark in the air by twisting and gesturing
with their left hand. This spark, when moved circularly, heats the
surrounding air, creating a gentle wind. With this wind, the gnome
directs a dried leaf from their heap to the water's edge of their
current plant. Stepping onto this leaf, the gnome then uses it as a
cable ferry, pulling along a tendril stretched between the plants to
cross to the next. This leaf boat is the asset that enables the gnome to
navigate from one situation to another.

These leaves represent action pathways: some lead outward to new plants
(external change and transitions), while others fold back onto the same
plant (internal reflection or reappraisal loops). The tendrils between
plants can be latent---already present but unseen---or actively
projected when the gnome throws them out, representing creative
problem-solving and hope. When the gnome's lantern brightens through
emotional awareness or receives glow powder from a crow's message,
hidden tendrils appear, revealing insights and connection discoveries.
Successfully connected tendrils pulse and thicken like living cables,
showing strengthened pathways to resources and possibilities.

This stage leverages principles from solution-focused brief therapy and
positive psychology. From this awareness, you can move towards
possibility. Expand your narrative understanding through the wisdom of
other \"gnomes\" (people or external knowledge) or your own inner
resources. Use SPARK to inventory the personal and interpersonal
resources available to you:

-   **S --- Strengths**: What abilities, traits, or skills do you bring
    to this moment? *Prompt: \"What are my core strengths, talents, or
    positive qualities that can help me navigate this situation? (e.g.,
    resilience, creativity, empathy, analytical thinking). Which of
    these strengths might help me see new tendrils or transform thorns
    into opportunities?\"*

-   **P --- Possibilities**: What courses of action exist? Be
    creative---don't filter options yet. *Prompt: \"Brainstorm at least
    3-5 different courses of action, even if they seem unconventional or
    difficult. What are all the potential ways forward? Which leaves
    from my heap might serve as vessels to other plants, and which might
    curl inward for deeper reflection?\"*

-   **A --- Assets**: What tangible and intangible resources (e.g.,
    tools, time, information, shared community resources) can you rely
    on? *Prompt: \"What tangible assets (e.g., time, money, specific
    tools, information) or intangible assets (e.g., reputation, trust,
    past successes) do I have access to? What dried leaves in my heap
    are ready to be used?\"*

-   **R --- Resourced Relationships**: Who can walk with you in this?
    Who offers strength, support, challenge, or insight? *Prompt: \"Who
    are the people in my network (friends, family, colleagues, mentors)
    who can offer support, advice, or a different perspective? Who can I
    reach out to? Which crows might carry messages that illuminate new
    tendrils or soften existing thorns?\"*

-   **K --- Knowledge & Experience**: What lessons have you already
    learned? What frameworks or facts do you already hold? *Prompt:
    \"What relevant knowledge or past experiences do I possess that
    could inform my approach? What frameworks or facts do I already hold
    that are relevant to this challenge? What 'glow powder' from past
    learning can I apply to brighten my current lantern?\"*

### 2.2 Yikes! (SAGE) --- Face Risks, Limits, and Priorities

On the tendril there are sage leaves growing, symbolizing the wisdom and
often bitter truths involved in facing risks. These sage leaves mark the
path between plants, reminding the gnome that growth requires navigating
thorns---points of friction, frustration, or pain where competence or
autonomy feels blocked. As the gnome develops workarounds through
emotional adaptation or cognitive reappraisal, new lighter tendrils grow
around or over these thorns. Sometimes, through the process of
wisdom-seeking and emotional growth, thorns transform into
buds---representing learning, adaptation, and new possibilities emerging
from past pain.

Before committing to action, reflect on risk, responsibility, and
refinement. Use **SAGE** to evaluate outcomes and adapt. This stage
integrates strategic foresight, stress inoculation training, and ACT
principles.

-   **S --- Spectrum**: Define three kinds of outcomes:

    -   **Scary**: What's the worst-case scenario? What would feel like
        a failure? *Prompt: \"If I take action, what is the absolute
        worst outcome I can imagine? What would be the biggest failure
        or loss? What thorns loom largest in my dimmed lantern light?\"*

    -   **Sufficient**: What's \"good enough\" to move forward? *Prompt:
        \"What would be a 'good enough' outcome? What's the minimum
        acceptable result that would allow me to move forward? At what
        point do some thorns become navigable rather than blocking?\"*

    -   **Successful**: What would a meaningful win look like? *Prompt:
        \"What would a truly meaningful win or ideal outcome look like
        for me in this situation? How might thorns transform into buds,
        and what new tendrils might become visible?\"*

-   **A --- Actions**: For each outcome, what are possible reactions or
    strategies?

    -   **Avoidance**: What might I try to escape or delay? *Prompt:
        \"What tendencies do I have to avoid or delay action in this
        situation, and what are the consequences of that avoidance? Am I
        staying too close to familiar thorns rather than exploring new
        tendrils?\"*

    -   **Anchoring**: What stable actions keep me grounded under
        stress? *Prompt: \"What stable, consistent actions can I take to
        stay grounded and resilient, even if the situation becomes
        stressful? How can I maintain my lantern's steady glow even when
        thorns are present?\"*

    -   **Aspiration**: What bold or creative steps move me toward
        success? *Prompt: \"What bold, creative, or values-aligned steps
        can I take to move towards my 'Successful' outcome? What new
        tendrils am I willing to throw out, even before they're proven
        real?\"*

-   **G --- Gauge**: Assess urgency and importance. *Prompt: \"Based on
    my desired outcomes and potential actions, which actions are most
    urgent and most important right now? What's the immediate next step?
    Which leaf should I step onto first?\"*

-   **E --- Evolution**: The world changes---and so do you. This step
    mirrors the OODA loop for continuous adaptation.

    -   **Examine**: What feedback are you receiving? *Prompt: \"What
        new information, reactions, or feedback am I observing from my
        actions or the environment? How has my plant changed? What new
        messages have crows brought?\"*

    -   **Evaluate**: What's working, what's not? *Prompt: \"Based on
        this feedback, what aspects of my plan or actions are working
        well, and what is not working as expected? Have new tendrils
        strengthened or have some thorns become more prominent?\"*

    -   **Edit**: What needs adjusting or dropping? *Prompt: \"What
        specific adjustments do I need to make to my approach, or what
        elements should I drop entirely? Should I change which leaf I'm
        using or adjust my lantern to see different tendrils?\"*

    -   **Expand**: Connect to the pain-points. Reflect on what changed
        through your Gnomy process. What pain points were resolved? What
        challenges remain or new tensions arose? Who benefited, who was
        affected, and what became clearer? Share this with those
        impacted by the results. This step isn't just closure---it's a
        bridge to the next cycle, grounding future action in real
        insight and shared learning. *Prompt: \"Reflect on the entire
        Gnomy process: What thorns transformed into buds? What pain
        points were resolved or eased? What new insights did I gain?
        What challenges or tensions remain, or have new ones arisen? Who
        benefited from my actions, and who was affected? What became
        clearer for me and for others? How will I share these insights
        with those impacted? When multiple gnomes exchanged messages,
        how did their collective pattern reshape plants---straightening
        tangled roots or growing new shared branches?\"*

## Feedback Loop

If your plan feels shaky, your emotions shift, or new obstacles appear,
it's like the gnome realizing their current plant isn't stable or the
path forward is unclear. In such moments, the gnome doesn't despair;
instead, they might return to **Step 0 (Grounding)** to steady their
footing on their current plant, or revisit **Step 1 (Narrative)** to
re-evaluate the story of where they are and where they want to go.

The Gnomy Framework, much like the interconnected plants in the pond, is
cyclical and flexible---designed for ongoing clarity, growth, and
recalibration as you navigate from one \"situation-plant\" to the next.
When the gnome's lantern dims or thorns seem insurmountable, returning
to earlier steps can brighten the light, reveal hidden tendrils, or
allow new messages from crows to transform perspective. Sometimes leaves
that once seemed to lead forward need to curl inward for deeper
reflection before true progress can be made. The framework honors this
natural rhythm of exploration, retreat, and renewed
advance---recognizing that thorns don't disappear instantly but can be
gradually transformed into buds through repeated engagement and evolving
understanding.

# Relationships Between Gnomes

Crows arrive carrying messages that cast new light upon the
thorns--illuminating hidden causes of pain or frustration and revealing
paths toward understanding.

Sparks gather from heaps of fallen leaves and from old tendrils that
have wrapped themselves around thorns or fragments of them. These sparks
represent acts of renewal--using experience and learned competence to
transform past obstacles into sources of energy.

Lenses help the gnome perceive relationships more clearly, bringing the
network of crows, plants, and tendrils into sharper focus.

Each pond represents the broader context or domain of life in which a
situation (plant) grows. Gnomes can move between ponds to experience new
contexts or perspectives. Gnomes standing on different plants can feel
empathy for one another's situations, yet still experience each other as
"you." When two gnomes stand on the same plant, sharing the same
situation, they experience "us." When a gnome stands alone, reflecting
within its own lantern's glow, it experiences "me."

The stakes of a situation are reflected in the brightness and steadiness
of the gnome's lantern light--the stronger and clearer the glow, the
more significant or personally invested the gnome feels in that
situation.

# Why the Gnomy Framework Should Work: Theoretical Foundations

The Gnomy Framework explicitly grounds its components in a range of
established psychological and strategic theories, asserting that these
foundations contribute to its efficacy. This theoretical alignment is a
significant aspect of its design and potential impact. Where Gnomy
extends or uniquely synthesizes these theories, it is explicitly noted.

## Mindfulness & Grounding (FIND the LENS)

DBT Mindfulness [@linehan1993cognitive] & MBSR [@kabat1990full] provide
strong evidence that grounding techniques like breathing and pausing
improve emotional regulation, reduce anxiety, and enhance cognitive
clarity. Gnomy's **FIND the LENS** sequence---integrating embodied
awareness, goal mapping, and the nuanced discernment of stakes---mirrors
widely used and validated techniques such as STOP and body scans in DBT,
while adding a critical layer of multi-perspective emotional appraisal.
The inclusion of 'Discern Stakes (and Divine Compassion)' in FIND, which
introduces a \"spiritual appraisal perspective\" and \"humble inquiry
into who is experiencing the highest emotional or physical
vulnerability,\" represents a conceptual extension beyond traditional
Lazarusian appraisal theory [@lazarus1984stress]. While potentially
broadening the framework's scope to existential concerns, this unique
addition aims to cultivate empathy and align with an understanding of
interconnected well-being.

## Narrative & Externalization (LUX + CROWS)

Psychological research and therapeutic models such as Narrative Therapy
[@white1990narrative], Internal Family Systems (IFS)
[@schwartz1995internal], and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
[@beck1979cognitive] support the idea that naming emotions and
constructing coherent narratives helps reduce distress and increase
meaning. The **LUX** step aligns with these methods by encouraging
emotional labeling, meaning-making, and introspective clarity through
the lens of longing, usefulness, and friction. Its integration of
neurochemistry (Dopamine, Serotonin, Noradrenaline) with the Kano
model's Attractive, Performance, and Must-Be features
[@kano1984attractive] is a highly innovative, cross-disciplinary
approach, suggesting a physiological basis for emotional responses tied
to perceived \"features\" of a situation. The **CROWS** stage brings in
elements of mentalization [@fonagy2002affect], perspective-taking, and
attachment theory [@bowlby1969attachment]---all essential for emotional
intelligence and relationship repair. Reflecting on the role of others
(real, imagined, past, future) creates space for compassion,
re-interpretation, and systemic insight.

## Resource-Oriented Thinking (SPARK)

**SPARK** mirrors concepts from solution-focused brief therapy
[@de1997building], positive psychology [@seligman2011flourish], and
resilience theory [@masten2001ordinary]. Shifting attention toward
resources, relationships, and internal strengths has been shown to
increase optimism, motivation, and problem-solving capacity. It also
encourages autonomy and competence---two key components of
self-determination theory [@ryan2000self].

## Risk Mapping & Action Planning (SAGE)

The **SAGE** component integrates strategic foresight/scenario planning
[@schoemaker1995scenario], stress inoculation training
[@meichenbaum1985stress], and values-based decision-making. By
identifying outcome spectrums (Scary---Sufficient---Successful) and
categorizing strategies (Avoid---Anchor---Aspire), users are better
equipped to evaluate trade-offs, mitigate anxiety, and act
intentionally. It also reflects ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)
principles by balancing risk acceptance with committed action
[@hayes1999acceptance], and the OODA loop
(Observe---Orient---Decide---Act) from military and strategic planning
[@boyd1986destruction]---creating a feedback loop that favors adaptive
iteration over rigid execution.

## Iterative and Cyclical Design

Unlike rigid frameworks, Gnomy is built for real-life messiness. Its
looping structure (returning to Grounding, Narrative, or Others when
stuck) aligns with how humans process uncertainty and change. This makes
it ideal for personal development, emotional healing, or strategic
leadership in unpredictable environments [@kolb1984experiential].

# Suggested Use Cases by Profession

  **Role**               **Example Use**
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Coach**              Guide a client through a business pivot using **LUX** to understand underlying emotional drives and then SPARK $\rightarrow$ SAGE to reframe fears and strategize action.
  **Therapist**          Use CROWS to help a client understand how childhood dynamics shape current interpersonal reactions, and then **LUX** to explore the emotional longing, usefulness, and friction present in their current relationships.
  **Team Facilitator**   Run a post-project debrief using **FIND the LENS** and **LUX** to explore what worked emotionally and interpersonally, specifically addressing the team's shared longing, perceptions of usefulness, and points of friction, and understanding the different perspectives of stakeholders.
  **Startup Founder**    Use SPARK to inventory team strengths and brainstorm pivot paths, followed by SAGE to stress-test risk scenarios, informed by insights from **LUX** regarding the team's intrinsic motivations (longing) and potential pain points (friction), and using **FIND the LENS** to anticipate stakeholder reactions.
  **Educator**           Integrate the Gnomy framework into leadership or emotional intelligence curricula to foster reflective decision-making, encouraging students to use **LUX** to analyze the emotional components of complex problems and **FIND the LENS** to develop empathy for diverse viewpoints.
  **Mediator**           Apply CROWS and SAGE with conflicting parties to find shared history, individual concerns, and acceptable compromises, enhanced by using **LUX** to understand the underlying emotional drivers (longing, usefulness, friction) contributing to each party's perspective, and employing **FIND the LENS** to clarify the different appraisal of stakes from each side.

# Summary: Why the World Needs Gnomy

In an era of burnout, isolation, polarization, and rapid change, the
Gnomy Framework gives people a structured, imaginative way to reconnect
with their inner compass and with each other. It invites emotional
honesty and strategic thinking into the same space---bridging feeling
and action, pain and power, isolation and connection. It empowers people
not just to cope, but to cultivate meaning, collaborate wisely, and lead
with heart.
