**Figure**: *A Gnomish Journey of Reflection*

Imagine this: A Gnomish Journey of Reflection. A small gnome stands at the edge of a path, ready to journey into a moment of reflection.

In their left shoulder, the gnome holds a lantern of current feeling. From bottles in their belt, filled with luminescent powder of different colors, the gnome pours some powder into the lantern, and it begins to glow. This represents the **FLAME** of their inner narrative.
