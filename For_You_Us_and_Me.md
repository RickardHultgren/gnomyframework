# For You, Us and Me
version 0.1
Lyrics by Rickard Hultgren

For YOU — may crows take flight! ; CROWS TAKE FLIGHT!

For YOU — may sparks ignite! ; SPARKS IGNITE!

For YOU — may the lens be clear,

for you to see,

in the lantern light!

---

For US — may crows take flight! ; CROWS TAKE FLIGHT!

For US — may sparks ignite! ; SPARKS IGNITE!

For US — may the lens be clear,

for us to see,

in the lantern light!

---

If the crow’s call fades, send it once more,

If one leaf fails, reach for one more.

If the spark hides, or the crow is gone,

clear the lens—move the view along.

---

For ME — may crows take flight! ; CROWS TAKE FLIGHT!

For ME — may sparks ignite! ; SPARKS IGNITE!

For ME — may the lens be clear,

for me to see,

in the lantern light!
