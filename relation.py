Yes â€” your draft pseudocode already mirrors the framework nicely. Iâ€™ll rewrite and structure it so it fully reflects the diagram and adds clarity on the decision logic, benignity checks, and outcomes:

# INPUT: observation of context, group, individuals
observe(context, group, individuals)

# Step 1: Detect violations (boundary / norm crossings)
violated_boundary = detect_violation(context, group, individuals)

if violated_boundary == NONE:
    maintain_connection()  # keep trust, openness
    return

# Step 2: Classify violation type
if violation_affects("other"):
    violation_type = "OTHER"
elif violation_affects("group"):
    violation_type = "WE"
elif violation_affects("self"):
    violation_type = "SELF"
else:
    violation_type = "UNKNOWN"

# Step 3: Evaluate benignity factors
benignity = evaluate_benignity(
    alternative_norms = check_alternative_norms(violated_boundary),
    commitment        = check_commitment_to_norm(violated_boundary),
    distance          = check_psychological_distance(context, violated_boundary)
)

if not benignity:
    # Serious violation â†’ prioritize protection
    respond_with_protection(violation_type)
    return

# Step 4: Select response mode + attitude
if violation_type == "OTHER":
    response_mode = "GENTLENESS"   # respectful correction
    attitude      = COMPASSION     # warmth, empathy
elif violation_type == "WE":
    response_mode = "PLAY"         # co-exploration, shared fun
    attitude      = CURIOSITY      # openness to explore
elif violation_type == "SELF":
    response_mode = "HUMOR"        # self-deprecating lightness
    attitude      = HUMILITY       # reduce ego, invite safety
else:
    response_mode = "REFLECTION"   # meta-communication
    attitude      = OPENNESS       # admit uncertainty

perform_response(response_mode, attitude)

# Step 5: Update outcomes dynamically
update_outcomes(
    trust_level       = measure_trust(),
    openness_level    = measure_openness(),
    critical_thinking = measure_group_reflection(),
    creativity        = measure_idea_generation()
)

ðŸ”‘ Key ideas in the pseudocode:

Boundaries/norms are the input conditions.

Violation type (self, other, we) maps to a distinct response mode (humor, gentleness, play).

Benignity factors act as a filter â€” they decide whether the violation can be engaged with constructively or needs protective response.

Attitudes/emotions (humility, compassion, curiosity, openness) shape how the response is delivered.

Outcomes (trust, openness, critical thinking, creativity) measure whether the group dynamic improved.


Would you like me to extend this pseudocode into a decision tree algorithm (something you could visualize as a flowchart) so itâ€™s easier to use as a practical tool in live group settings?
